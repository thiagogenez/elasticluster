# This playbook is for site-local customization to ElastiCluster's
# playbooks.  It runs *after* any other playbook distributed with
# ElastiCluster has gotten its chance to run.
#
# An empty playbook is checked into the Git repository.  If you make
# any local modifications, please run `git update-index
# --assume-unchanged after.yml` to avoid committing them accidentally
# into ElastiCluster's main branch.
